## How to add project?

Just create a pull request with the project details in `.json` format and place in most suitable folder inside `src/content/tools/`. You can browse any of the existing `.json` file to understand the data structure. You also need to add logo of the tool inside `public/logos/` folder, the size of the logo should be between (150px - 512px) and it should be square. Below is the example

```json
{
  "title": "ElevenLabs.",
  "logo": "eleven-lines-hqbg-min.png",
  "desc": "Explore the most advanced text to speech, voice cloning software and lifelike voiceovers for your content.",
  "date": "2023-08-16",
  "website": "https://elevenlabs.io/",
  "video": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRPTwPuZLjk"
}
```

```
- title is the name of the tool
- logo is name of the logo file (put it inside `public/logos` folder. Add png or jpg image )
- desc is the descrption of the tool. keep it less than 100 characters
- date (format yyyy-mm-dd) and string. Add the current date
- website is the actual url where a user can access the tool to learn more about it.
- video is the link of a video resource that a user can access and see its working. (this is optional but we recommed adding it)
